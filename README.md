# ShadeSort-BDL *TESTING*
This is a repository for all the open source code for the Shade Sort Device developed by Donovan Goodwin for Broadway Dental Laboratories, this device is build for the sole purpose of inventory management.


This code is writen for use on the Teensy3.2 by PJRC, this microcontroller contains a microprocessor that can be ran a 120mhz, this allows us to use an LCD for graphical lists that can be used to evaluate inventory in our store, Broadway Dental Lab. We have a fully custom keyboard(using the standard ps/2 interface) on a PCB with Power Management as well as the custom silicon used to scan the keyboard and convert it into a ps/2 interface, we then have it going to a standard teensy3.2 that reads the lines and based on the keypress it will do something, simple right? Well I wish it was, anyone with some time to burn could contribute here, email me if your interested in something to hone your skills.
