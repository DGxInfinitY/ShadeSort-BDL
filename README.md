# ShadeSort-BDL
This is a repository for all the open source code for the Shade Sort Device developed by Donovan Goodwin for Broadway Dental Laboratories, this device is build for the sole purpose of inventory management.


This code is now developed in Python, due to the simplicity of swaping out a teensy for a raspberry pi zero in my hardware design it makes more sense to use an already made platform and make software on that. This project has had major changes so here is the run down...

# Changelog
The code can be ran on a Ubuntu system(or similar) by downloading the index.py file found in the RaspberryPi folder and running <code>python3 index.py</code> I am now finnishing some of the core runctionality of the software.

# Timeline
Code has been swaped to Python for faster development.
